## Overview

This repository contains scripts designed to help users integrate **Calico Image Assurance** with **Azure DevOps Build Pipeline** for vulnerability management. The script automates the process of ensuring that only secure and compliant images are used during the build and deployment phases of your DevOps workflow.

For a comprehensive guide on the usage, purpose, and underlying process of these scripts, please refer to the related blog post: [Integrating Calico Image Assurance Vulnerability Management with Azure DevOps Build Pipeline](https://www.tigera.io/blog/deep-dive/integrating-calico-image-assurance-vulnerability-management-with-azure-devops-build-pipeline/).

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) configured with access to your project's build pipeline.
- **Calico Enterprise** or **Calico Cloud** installed in your Kubernetes cluster.
- Your Kubernetes cluster has network connectivity to **Azure DevOps** to ensure script execution.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone this repository.
